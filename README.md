# 🐍 Python Project: Date Utilities

This is a Python project created as part of the **"Python Programming Essentials"** course offered by **Rice University** on Coursera.

## 📚 Project Description

This project focuses on developing utility functions to perform **date validation** and **date calculations**. The main goal is to simulate how dates work behind the scenes without using advanced date libraries.

### ✅ Key Features

- ✅ Validate whether a date is legal (`is_valid_date`)
- 📅 Convert a date into total number of days from a reference point (`date_to_days`)
- 🧮 Calculate age in days between a date and the current server date (`age_in_days`)

These functions avoid using external libraries like `datetime` to align with course constraints and help deepen your understanding of:
- Leap year logic
- Days per month calculation
- Manual date arithmetic

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries (as per project rules)
